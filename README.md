# push_swap

## Overview
**push_swap** is a project that challenges you to sort a stack of integers using a limited set of operations, with the goal of achieving the task in the least number of moves possible. Youâ€™ll create an algorithm and use it to solve sorting problems of varying complexity.

This project strengthens your problem-solving skills, algorithm design, and understanding of data structures like stacks.

---

## Features
- Implements a set of sorting operations on two stacks (`a` and `b`).
- Supports handling edge cases such as duplicates and very large inputs.
- Provides efficient sorting solutions for varying stack sizes.

---

## Rules
The program must:
1. Take as input a list of integers (space-separated or as individual arguments).
2. Use two stacks (`a` and `b`).
3. Sort the integers in ascending order within stack `a`.
4. Use only the allowed operations:
   - `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: Swap the top two elements of a stack.
   - `pa`, `pb`: Push the top element of one stack to the other.
   - `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: Rotate a stack upwards.
   - `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: Rotate a stack downwards.

The program must output the sequence of operations required to sort the input.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:d2iv3r/push_swap.git
   cd push_swap
   ```
2. Build the program:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will generate the push_swap executable.


## Usage

**Running the Program**

To sort a stack of integers, provide them as arguments:
   ```bash
   ./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
   ```
   The program will output the sequence of operations required to sort the stack.

### Example
**Input:**
   ```bash
   ./push_swap 4 67 3 87 23
```
**Output:**
   ```bash
   pb
   ra
   ra
   pa
   ```
